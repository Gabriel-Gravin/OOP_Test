# 2 different ways

## Way one

- background is constantly moving when the player is moving

- put the speed at which the player is moving into a variable
- manipulate this variable to the background to move at a slower speed then the player moves
- background should move in the opposite direction as the player

## Way two

- background only moves when character reaches the side of the screen and is continuing to move

- detect when the player reaches the side of the screen
- put the player speed into a variable
- manipulate this variable to the background to move at a slower speed then the player moves
- background should move in the opposite direction as the player
